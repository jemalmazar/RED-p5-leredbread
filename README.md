**Project Epilogue**

This project introduced several new concepts: a new programming language (PHP), a content management system (CMS), and the WordPress Template Heirarchy. The latter was difficult to wrap my head around at first but became clearer once I began utilizing this [tree](http://wphierarchy.com/). After some time, it became clear that anything entered via the WordPress dashboard is saved on the MySQL database and that PHP was being used to extract that content to be displayed onto the page.

The biggest challenge during this project was the sheer amount of pages that had to be styled. Until I had my head fully wrapped around the WordPress Template Heirarchy, finding what template file to add classes to was difficult. Staying organized and efficient with CSS styles also became challenging with how many pages/layers the website had.

Overall, it was a rewarding learning experience. WordPress is a widely used platform for a reason and being able to leverage it as a tool on my development utility belt makes for a more versatile developer.
